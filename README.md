# Generate My Career
Generate My Career is a platform for generating common career documents such as cover letters, resumes, and LinkedIn summaries. It helps professionals save time during their job search by generating the documents they need in seconds as opposed to spending hours writing the documents themselves.

## Why I Made This Project
I've been using [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) ever since it was released to the public back in November. During my current job search, I've been consulting the bot often for creating summaries for applications, rephrasing resume bullet points, and even generating my entire LinkedIn profile summary. As I consulted the bot more, I decided to write little scripts using OpenAI's API to streamline this process.

There's one thing that I never seem to write though...and that's a cover letter! I mean...just how cumbersome are they to write?! And...would they even increase my chances of landing an interview? Eh, probably not, but creating a side project just might. And if I can use ChatGPT to help myself save time, it would be awesome if I can do the same for others through this project.
